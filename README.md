Market Simulator is a simple React App that simulates a very small stock market.
Each company has its own panel, updated every second, where you can see how the stock rate is doing.
Starting with Â£5000 cash, is up to you to decide the right moment to enter or leave the market by opening (BUY) or closing (SELL) positions.
